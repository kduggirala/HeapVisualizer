   Kiran:
          
          Copied and adapted code for pushUp and pushDown from the heap lab
          
          Added most heap methods including add, pop, clear, and heapify
      
  May 21:
         Kiran:
         
          
          Finished making heap by adding isMaxHeap boolean
          Error arose from use of generics in the Node class -> changed to only int
  
  May 22:
         Minuk: 
          
          Started draw method to display the nodes
          Created getxcor and getycor to calculate where the xcor and ycor of the node should be
          getxcor incorrect -> all the nodes on one level squished together
         
   Kiran: 
         
          Created display method for Nodes that creates a white circle with int inside
         
  May 23:
        Kiran: 
          
          Modified draw method to use Node display method
         
          Fixed getxcor to space nodes out correctly
        
   Minuk: 
          
          Started drawline method to draw lines between nodes
  
  May 24:
        Kiran: 
          
          Fixed pop method, created mechanism for user to remove values
          
          Displayed removed value on screen
          
          Found code for inputing number of processing forum(user Chrisir) and experimented with and modified it

          Allowed user input by pressing enter

   Minuk:
        
        Allowed clearing the heap by pressing delete key
        
        Stuck figuring out how to select node with mouse click
          
   Kiran:
        
        Stuck trying to get animation working
