        Kiran:
          
          Copied and adapted code for pushUp and pushDown from the heap lab
          
          Added most heap methods including add, pop, clear, and heapify

         Kiran:
         
          
          Finished making heap by adding isMaxHeap boolean
          Error arose from use of generics in the Node class -> changed to only int

         Minuk: 
          
          Started draw method to display the nodes
          Created getxcor and getycor to calculate where the xcor and ycor of the node should be
          getxcor incorrect -> all the nodes on one level squished together
         
         Kiran: 
         
          Created display method for Nodes that creates a white circle with int inside

        Kiran: 
          Modified draw method to use Node display method
          Fixed getxcor to space nodes out correctly
        
        Minuk: 
          Started drawing lines between nodes
  
  May 24:
        Kiran: 
          Fixed pop method, created mechanism for user to remove values
