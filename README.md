# HeapVisualizer

## Developement Log
  
  Day 1: 
        Copied and adapted code for pushUp and pushDown from the heap lab
        Added most heap methods including add, pop, clear, and heapify
  
  Day 2:
         Finished making heap by adding isMaxHeap boolean
         Error arose from use of generics in the Node class -> changed to only int
  
  Day 3:
         Started draw method to display the nodes
         Created getxcor and getycor to calculate where the xcor and ycor of the node should be
         getxcor incorrect -> all the nodes on one level squished together
         Created display method for Nodes that creates a white circle with int inside
         
  Day 4:
        Modified draw method to use Node display method
        Fixed getxcor to space nodes out correctly
        Started drawing lines between nodes
  
  Day 5:
        Fixed pop method, created mechanism for user to remove values
        Displayed removed value on screen
        Found code for inputing number of processing forum(user Chrisir) and experimented with and modified it
